Net::CUPS README
================

Net::CUPS is an interface to the Common Unix Printing System API.

Previous versions of this module attempted to provide a Perl interface
layer similar to the C interface of CUPS.  This was fine for power users,
but most people were not looking for this type of interface.

This module has now been converted to use an object oriented paradigm
to facilitate quicker development and ease of use.

The Common Unix Printing System can be found at http://www.cups.org.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   *) Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) - http://www.cups.org

The Makefile.PL will test for the version of the CUPS you have installed
and die if an appropriate version is not found.  This is due to the way
the module had to be coded to handle various variables and functions.
