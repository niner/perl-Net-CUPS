Revision history for Perl extension Net::CUPS.

0.61 Tue Aug 18 21:21:28 2009
	- Changes to build system to make it easier for packagers.

0.60 Thu Jul 30 08:28:18 2009
	- Graham Jenkins <graham@vpac.org> reported additional issues
	  with the cleanup in the DESTROY method.  Tweaked it to avoid
	  double free issues.

0.59 Wed Sep  3 13:56:12 2008
	- I really removed the test this time.

0.58 Thu Aug 21 10:04:32 2008
	- No changes to the core in this release.  This release is designed
	  to address issues with automated testing.  I have removed the
	  tests for manipulating destinations since they required to have
      accounts on the CUPS system.  I have also modified the Makefile.PL
	  to deal with issues in the Perl Testers systems.

0.57 Sun Aug 10 19:19:33 2008
	+ Special thanks to Mike Eldridge <diz@cpan.org> for submitting a 
      patch to correct issues with constants on certain platforms.
	- Small compile patch to deal with changes in Fedora 9.

0.56 Wed Mar 26 19:35:05 2008
	+ Most of the changes below were added by Mark Gannon <mark@truenorth.nu>
	- Added methods to Net::CUPS::Destination to get Uri, Location and
	  Description.
	- Added methods to Net::CUPS to get PPDs.
	- Added methods to Net::CUPS to create and delete destinations.
	- Corrected the issue of creating bastardized objects as reported by
	  Gunnar Wolf.

0.55 Tue Oct 09 20:46:58 2007
	- Fixed a segfault in getJobs [Sven-Haegar Koch]
	- The job hash from getJobs now returns the state!
	- Added a human readable state to the job hash [Sven-Haegar Koch]
	- Added basic examples of Net::CUPS operations.
	- The method getDestination() will attempt to get the default
	  destination on the server if a destination is not provided.

0.51 Wed Mar 14 10:35:16 2007
	- Attempt to rework the DESTROY method for Net::CUPS::Destination for
      a bug reported by Graham Jenkins <graham@vpac.org>
	- Added some extra commentary to the source.

0.50 Fri Feb 15 18:38:28 2007
	- Reworked the entire module into the new design. 

0.41 Sun Feb 26 22:14:45 2006
	- Added patch from Aike Reyer <aike@users.sourceforge.net> for dealing
	  with passwords.
	- Added SUPPORT and updated documentation.

0.40 Mon Nov 29 20:46:44 2004
	- It was pointed out to me that Network is probably not the best
      name for the integrated IPP and HTTP modules.  Instead they are
      now named Net::CUPS::Protocol.

0.37 Mon Nov  8 23:49:36 2004
	- Net::CUPS::IPP module has been moved to Net::CUPS::Network as the
	  initial plan to have seperate IPP and HTTP modules proved to be
	  an unwise design decision.
	- Added all HTTP constants to Net::CUPS::Network

0.35  Tue Oct 12 23:37:27 2004
	- Upgraded to handle the latest release of CUPS - 1.2.21
	- Added the SUPPORT disclaimer to the POD located in CUPS.pm.
	- Moved all typemaps into a global typemap.
	- Moved all pack/unpack functions into a globally accessible
	  area.
	- Fixed issue with running certain functions in Net::CUPS::Printer
	  without having any printers setup in the CUPS config.
	- Added constants to the Net::CUPS::IPP module.
	- Added more debugging and polishing to net-cups-lpr

0.30  Tue Dec  9 23:26:17 2003 (Not Distributed)
	- Added an simple example script demonstrating the usage of Net::CUPS.
	- Added a Net::CUPS::IPP stub.
	- Tweaked documentation.

0.25  Sat May 31 19:45:45 2003
	- Added constants to Net::CUPS::Printer.
	- Updated constants in Net::CUPS::PPD.
	- Added cupsAddDest, cupsGetPPD, cupsGetDest, cupsSetDests
	  to Net::CUPS::Printer.

	- Reworked the framework of the Net::CUPS module.

0.11  Mon Apr 07 12:00:00 2003
	- Added printer configuration option code and documented it.
	- I don't know why, but for some reason the typemap file was missing from
	  the CPAN tarball.  Does 'make dist' not include them in the final
	  package?

0.10  Wed Feb 26 13:18:44 2003
	- First public release of Net::CUPS.
